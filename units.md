Base units:
-
> Time: temp (1 temp = 1 millisecond)
> 
> Length: lon (1 lon = 1 screen width or 1 screen height, whichever is smaller)
> 
> Mass: mas
> 
> Angle: radian

The rest of the units do not exist yet

Derived units:
-
> Speed: cel = lon * temp⁻¹
> 
> Acceleration: ac = cel * temp⁻¹ = lon * temp⁻²
